/**
 * SignatureProvider abstraction.
 *
 * Assessors Studio supports both CycloneDX signature formats through
 * one provider interface. JSF (the CycloneDX jsf-0.82 subschema) is
 * the format for CycloneDX 1.x. JSS (ITU-T X.590, the JSON signature
 * scheme) is the format for CycloneDX 2.x. Route code never talks to
 * a concrete library: it asks a SignatureProvider to canonicalize,
 * sign, and verify, and the registry decides which implementation
 * answers. The mapping from spec version to provider lives in
 * `signatures/index.ts`.
 *
 * A provider owns:
 *   1. Canonicalization of the JSON payload (for JSF: JCS / RFC 8785;
 *      for JSS: the canonical JSON form defined by ITU-T X.590).
 *   2. The list of algorithm identifiers it can produce or consume.
 *   3. The sign step, which returns a signed envelope plus the raw
 *      material the audit log needs to store.
 *   4. The verify step, which returns a structured outcome suitable
 *      for rendering to an end user.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally thin. Both shipped formats are
 * JSON-native and can carry the verifying key inside the envelope, so
 * providers are free to embed public keys, defer to an external trust
 * anchor, or store them out of band as appropriate for their format.
