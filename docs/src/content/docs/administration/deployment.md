description: Install Assessors Studio in Docker for evaluation or production, with PGlite or external PostgreSQL.
---

Assessors Studio is distributed as a single container image that serves both the Vue 3 single-page application and the JSON API on the same origin. This page covers the three supported deployment topologies: a quick-start evaluation install, a production install against PostgreSQL, and a reverse-proxy fronted deployment with TLS.

The canonical image is `docker.io/cyclonedx/cyclonedx-assessors-studio`. Snapshot tags are published from the main branch; versioned tags are published from GitHub releases; `latest` tracks the most recent non-prerelease.

## Quick start with PGlite

PGlite is an embedded PostgreSQL implementation that lives inside the container. It is ideal for evaluation, single-operator use, and small installations that do not need an external database.

Download the evaluation Compose file:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-assessors-studio/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application is available at `http://localhost:3001`. The first request is redirected to the setup wizard, where you create the initial administrator account. See [First Login](/getting-started/first-login/) for the wizard walkthrough.

The Compose file defines a single `app` service and an `app-data` named volume that holds the embedded database. No environment variables are required; the backend generates a JWT signing secret on first run and persists it alongside the rest of the application state.

To override settings, create a `.env` file next to the Compose file or pass variables on the command line:

```bash
APP_PORT=8080 JWT_SECRET=... docker compose up -d
```

The full list of variables is in the [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables/) reference. The most common override in an evaluation install is `APP_PORT` to publish on something other than 3001.

## Production with PostgreSQL

Production installations should use an external PostgreSQL 17 database. The production Compose file runs a `db` service and an `app` service, with the app depending on the database's health check.

Download the production Compose file:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-assessors-studio/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.production.yml
```

Set at minimum `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `APP_IMAGE` (pinned to a specific snapshot tag for production; no stable release is available yet):

```bash
export APP_IMAGE=cyclonedx/cyclonedx-assessors-studio:snapshot-20260412-abc1234
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<generated-strong-password>
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

For multi-replica production, set `JWT_SECRET` explicitly so every replica signs with the same secret. A generated 32+ character random string is suitable:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

If you manage the database outside of Docker (managed PostgreSQL service), remove the `db` service from the Compose file and point `DATABASE_URL` at your instance. Every setting driven by `DATABASE_URL` is documented on the [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables/) page.

## Behind a reverse proxy

Assessors Studio does not terminate TLS. For production you should place a reverse proxy in front of the container. Any proxy works: nginx, Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy, a cloud load balancer. The proxy responsibilities are:

- Terminate TLS on port 443 with a valid certificate.
- Forward decrypted traffic to the application on port 3001.
- Set standard proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`).

Example with Caddy:

```txt
studio.example.com {
  reverse_proxy app:3001
}
```

Example with nginx:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name studio.example.com;
  ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass         http://app:3001;
    proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
    proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host  $host;
  }
}
```

Set `APP_URL` and `CORS_ORIGIN` on the application to the public URL so notification links and API call origins are correct:

```
APP_URL=https://studio.example.com
CORS_ORIGIN=https://studio.example.com
```

## Running without Docker Compose

The image can be run directly with `docker run` or deployed via any container orchestrator (Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS). The runtime requirements are:

- Port 3001 reachable inside the cluster.
- A writable data volume mounted at `/app/data` if PGlite is in use, or network access to PostgreSQL if the external provider is configured.
- Access to the configured evidence storage (the database itself or an S3-compatible endpoint).
- Outbound access to any configured notification endpoints.

The [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables/) reference lists every setting that controls runtime behavior.

## Verifying the install

Check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

A healthy instance returns `{"status":"ok"}`. The `/metrics` endpoint (when `METRICS_ENABLED=true`) exposes Prometheus metrics. Application logs stream to stdout in JSON format; capture them with your usual container log pipeline.

## What to do next

After the container is healthy:

1. Complete the setup wizard ([First Login](/getting-started/first-login/)).
2. Invite co-administrators ([Users and Permissions](/administration/users-and-permissions/)).
3. Configure the notification channels your organization uses ([Integrations](/administration/integrations/)).
4. Decide on storage for evidence ([Evidence Storage](/administration/storage/)).
5. Enable encryption at rest if applicable ([Encryption at Rest](/administration/encryption-at-rest/)).
6. Plan your first backup schedule ([Backup and Recovery](/administration/backup-and-recovery/)).
